Make a black circle

Make it smaller

Position the circle absolutely anywhere

Animate the circle to move both horizontally and vertically forever

Create a rectangle at the bottom of the page horizontally centered

When I press the left arrow key, move the rectangle to the left.

if the rectangle and the circle overlap, make the circle go in the opposite direction.

Now track a score. Display the current score in the top left with the label: Score: .

make the score label larger

increment the score by 1 every second.

if the circle touches the bottom of the page, decrease the score by 10 and show a label underneath the scoreLabel that says Points lost! hide the label one second after it appears.
